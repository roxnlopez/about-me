## Two Truths and a Lie

## My LinkedIn
[Here!](coming soon)

## Meetups I've attended:
1. 

## What type of company would you like to work for (i.e. Agency, Product, Startup)?
I want to work for a small'ish company.  Coming from an international firm, I've learned I do not want to be in corporate america or big firm. Also, somewhere a little more relaxed than professional business would be nice.

## What kind of role are you leaning towards (i.e. Frontend, Backend, etc)?
I don't really know at this point but I think I want to be in a role that is versatile where I can do front and back with a goal of doing all back end.
