# About Me

Whatever Nick & Becca want to offer.

## Two Truths and a Lie

## My LinkedIn

## Meetups I've attended:
1. Denver Scripts
2. Coffee and Code

## What type of company would you like to work for (i.e. Agency, Product, Startup)?
I want to work for a small'ish company.  Coming from an international firm, I've learned I do not want to be in corporate america or big firm. I wouldn't turn down an agency, though either. Also, somewhere a little more relaxed than professional business would be nice.

## What kind of role are you leaning towards (i.e. Frontend, Backend, etc)?
I'm leaning towards front end but with time still want something that is versatile where I can do front and back with a goal of doing all back end. Or SQL; that is fun and organized.
